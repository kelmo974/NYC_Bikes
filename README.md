## Purpose
It is imperative to have useful data prior to developing any type of visualizations. Pandas was employed to manipluate the data and then produce a tidy CSV which could then be imported to Tableau. The exploration and vizualizations contained within this repo offer insight to the feasability of launching a bike share service in a small-to-midsize city

## Results
The following series of viziualizations depict the ongoings of CITI Bike rides and users in NYC during August of 2019. Examining parameters such as usertype, gender, and ride duration produced some key insights into the way CITI Bike operates. This data can serve as sort of proxy for their potential revenue and viability in other areas, though it should be noted that NYC is a unique zone and lifestyle for pedestrians and bike traffic alike. This analysis may not translate too well to a city or town with limited transportation options. See the below charts:

The above pie chart shows a strong contigency of CITI Bike users are subcribers - Nearly 80%. Perhaps the search for additional revenue, especially in a smaller city, may need to rely on reeling in more one-off uses.

The gender pie chart demonstrates that a very high section of users identify as Males - nearly 70%. Is there a way to entice more females to choose CITI Bike transportation? Would that be even more difficult in a smaller hub?

This line graph illustrates the total amount of time spent on the bike during each use/ride. It is noted that approximately 5 minutes is the most common range for duration. There is also an observable drop-off after the 1-hour mark. Could this be explained by simply always reaching the destination within one hour or are people avoiding a expense penalty by continuing for hour 2?

The second line chart here is split by gender. It would seem that duration trends are consistent regardless gender.

A heatmap here visualizes which days of the week see the most CITI Bike usage and at what specific hour. Weekdays post-work hours are clearly the heaviest use times. Therefore, expansion to a smaller city should keep in mind that a lesser commute culture may negatively impact usage.

Much like the overall line chart vs its gendered counterpart, this heatmap doesn't deviate from the trends of the overall heatmap, but does serve as a reminder that less females are opting for CITI Bike than males.

The final heatmap here shows what a strong impact on usage male subscribers have on the overall CITI Bike usage data. This seems to be atrributable to males being willing to commute to work with CITI Bike.


## Summary

Upon insepecting the data closely, and with the aid of Tableau vizualization, that NYC CITI Bike revenue largely hinges upon male use. More specifically, it is a strong option for males users to repeatedly commute to work by riding CITI Bike. 

As conveyed, NYC CITI Bike greatly benefits from male commuters during the peak commute hours of weekdays. Outside of those numbers, there is a sizeable drop in usage. It would be important to not only combat this defficiency in NYC, but also take measures to minimize this issue when expanging to another city that may not have the benefit of such a strong car-free commute culture.
